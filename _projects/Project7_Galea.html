Using the OpenBCI Galea, we recreated a well-known neuroscience experiment called the N-back test in virtual reality. This was during
the Queen's University Neurotech MicroCredential capstone project. Here, I collaborated with a team of 4 neurotech enthusiasts in validating and testing the OpenBCI GALEA virtual reality headset by running an
N-back memory test in virtual reality and comparing the EEG signals with the g.tec Unicorn. I developed data acquisition software in Python to collect, store, and synchronize EEG signals from the GALEA
during the N-back test. I also programmed Python scripts for offline data analysis, eliminating noise from EEG data and performing ERP and
band power analysis
