Designed and 3D-printed a Spider-Man webslinger prosthetic for young hand amputees, allowing them to shoot webs like Spider-Man using EMG signals.
I built an EMG circuit using analog filters, a full-wave rectifier, an envelop, a digitizer, and an Arduino to control a Spider-Man webslinger mechanism.
I used LTSPice to simulate the EMG circuit schematic to facilitate the development the EMG circuit design.
