As the main controls student, I worked on the programming and electrical aspects of the robot, programmed software that allowed drivers to operate robot mechanisms reliably, developed and implemented autonomous programs that allows the robot to follow paths and perform tasks autonomously, and taught students how to program in Java and how to utilize different libraries to program an operational robot
