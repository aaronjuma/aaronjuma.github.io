MINDCRAFT! <br /><br />

PLAY MINECRAFT WITH JUST YOUR THOUGHT AND A HAND.<br /><br />

Using EEG, you can move around Minecraft. Using EMG, you can place and break blocks in Minecraft. This was our submission for Hack the North 2025.

I developed a lightweight deep learning model in Python and TensorFlow to decode EEG into movement intention and EMG into discrete gestures. The good thing with this model is that it doesn't require a lot of data to be effective, it only requires around 5 minutes of data to achieve 70% testing accuracy.

<br /><br />This was our submission for 2025 Hack the North hackathon.
