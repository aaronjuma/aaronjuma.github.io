Hello! I am Aaron, a 3rd year biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I am very passionate about brain-computer interfaces, neuroscience, machine learning, robotics, virtual reality, and gaming. My life-long goal is to be able to build non-invasive BCIs that can decode motor intentions to control prosthetics and video games.

Overall, I am interested in working in any type of neural decoding. My three main interests in neural decoding are kinematics, speech, and memory.

Hopefully in the future, I also get the chance to work on neurostimulation, and work on exciting projects such as sense restoration and rehabilitation.

Another cool project I would also like to work on is modelling the brain and potentially building a full-scale brain model that can do things (read, write, move, talk).
