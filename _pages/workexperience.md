## Neural Decoding & Machine Learning Research Intern  
**Integrated Neurotechnologies Lab at EPFL** — Geneva, Switzerland  
*May. 2025 – Aug. 2025*  

- Engineered a lightweight deep learning model using PyTorch for on-chip EMG spasticity detection, achieving 93%
classification accuracy and enabling deployment in a portable patient-assistive neuroprosthetic device.
- Optimized encoder architectures to boost EMG-based finger position decoding by 5% (86% accuracy), supporting
real-time robotic prosthetic control while maintaining low computational cost for embedded integration.
- Adapted the decoding model to EEG, ECoG, and intracortical spiking datasets, achieving up to 85% motor
decoding accuracy and demonstrating robust cross-signal reliability for brain–computer interface applications.
